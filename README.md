}

Format is given to you.

Note:

ProductCode : is generated randomly 5 digit
Id: 1 to wine.length
image: ""
hoverImage:""
placeIcon: ""

this thing you need to keep in mind


you have array you need to give me json data with the given keys. you need to fill data in the correct place 
json data length should be wineName.length;
